POS tagging

To run the code, run the POSTagger.m file. A results file will be created in a file called results.txt.
Ensure that the HMM toolbox folder is in the path before running.
The test file must be named posdata_test.txt. To change this, add the new file name to line 89 of POSTagger.m 

HMM Toolbox is required to run this code as it implements Viterbi Algorithm required for making predictions.
